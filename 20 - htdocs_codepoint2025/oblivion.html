      <article class="stuff">
        <p>
          The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is an action role-playing
          game co-developed by Virtuos and Bethesda Game Studios and published
          by Bethesda Softworks. It is a remaster of 2006's The Elder Scrolls
          IV: Oblivion and includes a full graphics overhaul using Unreal Engine
          5 and various other improvements, from sprinting to redesigned menus.
          The original's expansion packs, Knights of the Nine and Shivering
          Isles, are part of Oblivion Remastered. The game was announced on
          April 22, 2025, and released the same day for Windows, PlayStation 5,
          and Xbox Series X/S to generally favorable reviews.
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          The game retains the open world structure and core gameplay mechanics
          of the original, including real-time combat, character leveling,
          skill-based progression, and questlines tied to multiple factions. The
          remaster includes a full graphical overhaul with modern rendering
          techniques, ray tracing, and updated textures and models. Non-playable
          character behavior has been revised using improved AI, and all
          animations have been updated. The user interface and control schemes
          have also been redesigned for compatibility with current-generation
          hardware. Audio enhancements include re-recorded ambient sounds,
          environmental effects, and limited redone voice work. Knights of the
          Nine and Shivering Isles, which are paid expansion packs of the
          original game, are included in the remaster.
        </p>
        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>
          The game is set in the province of Cyrodiil, and the player takes the
          role of the Hero of Kvatch, who is drawn into a conflict involving the
          Daedric realm of Oblivion after the assassination of Emperor Uriel
          Septim VII.
        </p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          The game was co-developed by Virtuos' Paris studio and Bethesda Game
          Studios. Both studios began development of the remaster in 2021. The
          developers used Unreal Engine 5 to enhance the visuals, while relying
          on the Gamebryo engine for core elements like physics and combat.
          Initial indications of the remaster emerged in September 2023, when
          internal Microsoft documents (dated 2020) disclosed during the Federal
          Trade Commission v. Microsoft case referenced, among other unannounced
          titles, an "Oblivion Remaster" slated for release in the 2022 fiscal
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further speculation arose in April 2025 following the discovery of
          in-game images and promotional materials on Virtuos' website, which
          were subsequently shared online. The images, found through an
          accessible WordPress file repository, showed recognizable themes such
          as the player's first view of the outside world upon leaving the
          tutorial quest, the Imperial City and its surroundings, and several
          other highlights. On April 21, 2025, Bethesda confirmed the remaster's
          existence by announcing a livestream scheduled for the following day,
          when the game was released for Windows through Steam, PlayStation 5,
          and Xbox Series X/S, in addition to day-one availability on the Xbox
          Game Pass. The live announcement on YouTube was watched by more than
          600,000 people.
