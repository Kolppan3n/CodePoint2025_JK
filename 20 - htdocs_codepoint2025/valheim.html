          Valheim is an upcoming survival and sandbox video game by the Swedish
          developer Iron Gate Studio and published by Coffee Stain Studios.
          It was released in early access on 2 February 2021 for Linux and
          Windows via Steam, and for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 14 March
          2023. The game was developed by a five-person team, building on
          development work which Richard Svensson had undertaken as a side
          project in his spare time. Since its early access release, Valheim
          has achieved both critical and commercial success, being praised as a
          "rare exception" of a refined early access game. A month after its
          release, it had sold over five million copies and was one of the most
          played games on Steam.
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          Valheim is an open-world survival game played from a third-person
          perspective. As fallen Vikings, players must craft tools, build
          shelters and fight enemies to survive. The game uses low-resolution
          stylized 3D graphics, with a combat system inspired by action games.
          Co-operative gameplay with up to ten people and optional PvP gameplay
          is also supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main objective of the game is to kill the seven bosses located in
          different biomes of the game. To summon each boss, players must travel
          to each boss' altar and give a specific item as an offering. Bosses
          will drop a collectable trophy when killed; this trophy can be placed
          at a central altar to grant each player a special power-up. Power-ups
          can be used infinitely, but the player needs to wait for a brief
          period between uses.
        </p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          Valheim is developed by Iron Gate Studio, a small Swedish game
          development studio formed during the game's production. Studio
          co-founders Richard Svensson and Henrik Tornqvist were both coworkers
          at a local game development company called Pieces Interactive. Before
          Valheim, Svensson had previously begun development on a simulation
          game called Tolroko in his spare time; however, this game was
          ultimately unreleased. According to Tornqvist, Svensson realized that
          it was "redundant to implement simulation systems for their own sake,
          rather than for the player". With his next game, Svensson wanted to
          make an open-world experience where its simulations improved the
          player's experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Svensson began working on Valheim in 2017 under the working title of
          Fejd (Swedish for "feud"). He ended up leaving Pieces Interactive in
          2018 to work on Valheim full time, and convinced Tornqvist to join him
          later that year. The game was released into alpha in June 2018 and
          officially released into early access in February 2021. Continued
          support for the game is planned, and it involves the expansion of
          unfinished biomes, as well as improvements to fundamental game
          mechanics.
