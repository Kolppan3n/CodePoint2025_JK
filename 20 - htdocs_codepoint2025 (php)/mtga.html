      <article class="stuff">
        <p>
          Magic: The Gathering Arena or MTG Arena is a free-to-play digital
          collectible card game developed and published by Wizards of the Coast
          (WotC). The game is a digital adaption based on the Magic: The
          Gathering (MTG) card game, allowing players to gain cards through
          booster packs, in-game achievements or microtransaction purchases, and
          build their own decks to challenge other players. The game was
          released in a beta state in November 2017, and was fully released for
          Microsoft Windows users in September 2019, and a macOS version on June
          25, 2020. Mobile device versions were released in March 2021.
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          MTG Arena follows the same rules as the physical card game, in which
          players use decks of cards that include land cards that generate five
          separate colors of mana, and play cards that consume that mana to
          summon creatures, cast offensive and defensive spells, and/or activate
          effects and abilities. Players battle other players using a selected
          deck, with the goal of reducing the opponent's life-total to zero
          before their opponent can do the same to them.
        </p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          Arena is designed to be a more modern method of playing Magic: The
          Gathering with other players while using a computer compared to Magic:
          The Gathering Online. A key goal of its development was to allow Arena
          to remain current with physical releases of new expansions to the
          physical game, with the goal of having the digital version of the
          expansion available the same day in retail. For example, the Dominaria
          expansion was released simultaneously as a retail product and within
          Arena on April 27, 2018, and "Core 19" was available in Arena on the
          same day as the set's paper release date of July 13, 2018. Since 2020,
          new sets have released in MTG:Arena and MTG:Online one day before the
          set's prerelease date, typically the Thursday before a set releases
          for paper tabletop magic. Arena follows Magic the Gathering's Standard
          format, where cards from the last few major expansions are used to
          construct decks for Standard constructed play and are then rotated out
          of Standard on a set schedule. After cards are rotated out of
          Standard, players can construct decks with rotated cards for play in
          various "Historic" modes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core part of the development of Arena was its game rules engine
          (GRE). The goal of this engine was to make a system that could handle
          current and future rulesets for Magic to support their plan to remain
          concurrent with the physical releases. The GRE provided means to
          implement per-card level rules and effects, allowing it to be
          expandable. The GRE also helped speed up play in the game. Compared to
          other digital card games like Hearthstone where an opponent cannot
          interact during a player's turn, Magic: The Gathering allows opponents
          to react throughout a player's turn. In previous iterations of Magic
          games that allowed this, including both Online and Duels of the
          Planeswalkers, these systems were found to slow down the game while
          waiting for an opponent to react or opt not to react. Instead, in
          Arena, the developers could use the per-card support to determine when
          reactions to a played card needed to be allowed, using observations
          from Magic tournament play. This helped to speed up the game for both
          players while still allowing for complete card reactions to be played
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arena had its full release for Windows users on September 26, 2019,
          aligned with the release of the tabletop card game expansion, Throne
          of Eldraine. The macOS client released on June 25, 2020. An early
          access version for certain Android devices was released on January 28,
          2021, while full versions for all Android and iOS devices were
          released on March 24, 2021. These versions support cross-save
          progression with the desktop clients.
